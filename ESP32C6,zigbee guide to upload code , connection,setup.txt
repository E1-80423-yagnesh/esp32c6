# Arduino-ESP32 Zigbee AC Electrical Measurement Example

This example shows how to configure the Zigbee router device and
 use it as a Home Automation (HA) AC electrical measurement device that reports voltage, 
current, power, and frequency measurements.

Arduino IDE:

Install the latest version of Arduino IDE from arduino.cc
Add ESP32 board support to Arduino IDE:

Open Arduino IDE
Go to File > Preferences
In "Additional Board Manager URLs, " add: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager
Search for "esp32" and install the latest version

Tools--->Board--->Board manager--->ESP32 install

Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino >ESP32C6 Dev Module


To upload code:

---> connect Tx-Rx,Rx-Tx,GND-GND, 3.3v-3.3v

---> press "->"
     wait for connecting once come press and release together IOO and reset quickly(1 sec)

     or open serial monitor press and release together IOO and reset quickly(1 sec)(recommended)

---> code uploaded





ESP32 WiFi

--> In STA(station) mode ESP32 gets IP address from router:
    ESP 32 is another station of your router like phones, laptops ,pc etc.
    ESP32 gets IP address from router DHCP

--> In SAP(soft acess point) mode ESP32 assigns IP addresses to clients:
    ESP 32 is center of network providing connectivity to external devices like phone,laptop,pc etc
    ESP32 assigns IP address to client

--> Maximum of 5 clients in SAP mode

--> Both modes allow ESP32 to  as a webserver, adjustable Tpower upt 20.5dBm

--> ESP32 supports WiFi protocols 802.11 b/g/n,operates at 2.4GHz,Datarates:upto 150Mbps

--> in Arduino ide WiFi.h library used



ESP32 Bluetooth

--> ESP32 has both  classic Bluetooth(for continuos data streaming) : wireless headset,keyboard,audio devices 
    file transfer between pc and phone,
    and BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy)(short burst of connection): Medical Monitors,Fitness bands,IOT Sensors etc. 

--> can act as a client or as a server
